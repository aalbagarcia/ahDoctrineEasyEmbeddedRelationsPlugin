## Version 1.3 ##

    * check for LocalKey/ForeignKey relation? Because it's only possible now to 
      correctly embed relations that have a field in them that corresponds to one 
      of the field in the embedding form:
          * ahProjectmanagerProject (APP) embeds ahProjectmanagerSubversionRepository (APSR), 
            where APSR has the project_id field that corresponds to APP's id field
        This is a problem because:
          * APP embeds sfGuardUser (SGU), where SGU has no field that corresponds to APP's id field
            *but* APP has a user_id field that corresponds to SGU's id field!
    * check for one-to-one relations because if the relation exists there's no need for an "Add new" form!

## Version 1.5 ##

    * try improving and abstracting the functionality to ignore empty "add new" forms so this does not have 
      to be managed in the embedding form class anymore
        - 1st option is to add a `considerEmptyFields` method to the embedded form class (easy to implement, no need to 
          update the embedding form class when the embedded form's model changes (add/remove fields), which could be forgotten
        - 2nd option is trying to figure out after submit if the form to add a new related record can be considered empty:
            * remove all validators that are optional and are empty (needs to be both because the user can also enter something non-required!)
            * if the form then has the maximum errors that can exist in the form then the form is empty because the user 
              did not change anything or filled in any information
            Example:
              * sfGuardUser model
              * fields: username, firstname, lastname, gender, zip, city
              * username, firstname, and lastname are mandatory
              * gender, zip, and city are optional
              * on submit:
                * the optional fields are all tested for emptiness ($validator->isEmpty()), 
                  if one is not empty, form is considered "not empty"
                * the rest is tested for number of errors so I need to know the maximum number of errors 
                  that can be thrown from there; if this number is equal to the number of errors the form has thrown 
                  after validation then - bingo! - the form is considered "empty"
